# Responsive Web Design 
### Online Resources

#### TIPS FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGN	
1. Learn code
2. Depending on the project, try designing mobile-first.
3. Give up the notion of rigidity
4. Think about the user first
5. Think about the differences in the various media (desktop, mobile, etc.)
  - Hover states (won’t show up on mobile)
  - Text-size (larger on mobile for easier reading?)
  - Keeping things “touchable” (size of texts or buttons)
  - Consider margins around buttons (avoid accidental clicking)
6. Don’t forget to add 
  `<meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”>`
7. Test on a range of devices
